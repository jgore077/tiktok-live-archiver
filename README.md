The TikTok Live Archiver is designed to monitor a TikTok users livestreams. It will check every minute whether they are live or not and if they are it will start recording. Once the recording is finished it will upload it to your Internet Archive account. The script is ran through a bash file that creates an infinite loop so errors will cause the program to restart.
